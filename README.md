welcome to Buckshot Roulette!

this game works by having a random amount of live and blank rounds in the chamber and is randomly generated,
it is up to both players to empty the entire chamber until someone loses all 3 lives when playing against the other player,
it is up to both players to test their luck in this game by choosing to either take the chance of not being hit or to hit their opponent with a random round
the only keys needed to play are by inputting 1 to test your own luck and take a risk of your own life but keep your turn, or 2 to test your opponents luck,
after that the game will inform the loser if their shot was a blank or a live round, if its blank nothing happens but if its live someone will lose a life.
this will keep going on continuously until 1 remains with all lives....

good luck and may luck be on your side!
